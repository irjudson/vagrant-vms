vagrant-vms
===========

A repo to keep my collection of vagrant vms.

1.	Nitrogen - A virtual machine running the nitrogen service (api) and admin web application. Ports are mapped through localhost when running locally. 
1.	Jaglion - A virtual cluster (only on azure) that provides a small cloudera test environment.
